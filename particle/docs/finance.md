# Finance

Generally speaking, finance is easy, we won't be VAT registered and will have
minimal/no outgoings until we actually start making coin.

To start with essentially it would be a shell company which we can use for
contract provision. Once it has income, as long as it's below the VAT
threshold it's simple. IR35 isn't a worry, and we can accrue profit and do
infrequent Dividend payments.

We should also avoid either salary or directors loans to start with, keep it
really, really simple until it's cash positive.
